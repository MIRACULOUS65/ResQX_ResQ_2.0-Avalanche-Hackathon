## Overview

This project uses the following tech stack:
- Vite
- Typescript
- React Router v7 (all imports from `react-router` instead of `react-router-dom`)
- React 19 (for frontend components)
- Tailwind v4 (for styling)
- Shadcn UI (for UI components library)
- Lucide Icons (for icons)
- Clerk (for authentication)
- Framer Motion (for animations)
- Three js (for 3d models)
- Firebase (for backend services)

All relevant files live in the 'src' directory.

Use npm for the package manager.

## Setup

This project is set up with Clerk authentication and Firebase backend services.

## Environment Variables

The project requires the following environment variables:

### Required:
- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Your Clerk publishable key for authentication

### Optional:
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Firebase project ID for backend services
- `VITE_VLY_APP_ID` - Vly development tool ID (optional)
- `VITE_VLY_MONITORING_URL` - Vly monitoring URL (optional)

## Authentication

This project uses **Clerk** for authentication. The authentication system is already integrated and ready to use.

### Using Clerk Auth

The application automatically handles authentication state. When Clerk is properly configured:

- Users can sign in/sign up through the landing page
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
- User data is available throughout the application

### Authentication Components

- Landing page has sign-in/sign-up functionality
- Dashboard is protected and requires authentication
- User profile information is displayed when authenticated

### Development Mode

If `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is not set, the application runs in development mode without authentication, allowing you to test the UI and functionality.

## Protected Routes

The application uses Clerk's authentication system. Protected routes automatically redirect unauthenticated users to the landing page where they can sign in.

### Using Protected Routes

The `ProtectedRoute` component wraps routes that require authentication:

```typescript
<Route path="/dashboard" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <Dashboard />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

# Frontend Conventions

You will be using the Vite frontend with React 19, Tailwind v4, and Shadcn UI.

Generally, pages should be in the `src/pages` folder, and components should be in the `src/components` folder.

Shadcn primitives are located in the `src/components/ui` folder and should be used by default.

## Page routing

Your page component should go under the `src/pages` folder.

When adding a page, update the react router configuration in `src/main.tsx` to include the new route you just added.

## Shad CN conventions

Follow these conventions when using Shad CN components, which you should use by default.
- Remember to use "cursor-pointer" to make the element clickable
- For title text, use the "tracking-tight font-bold" class to make the text more readable
- Always make apps MOBILE RESPONSIVE. This is important
- AVOID NESTED CARDS. Try and not to nest cards, borders, components, etc. Nested cards add clutter and make the app look messy.
- AVOID SHADOWS. Avoid adding any shadows to components. stick with a thin border without the shadow.
- Avoid skeletons; instead, use the loader2 component to show a spinning loading state when loading data.


## Landing Pages

You must always create good-looking designer-level styles to your application. 
- Make it well animated and fit a certain "theme", ie neo brutalist, retro, neumorphism, glass morphism, etc

Use known images and emojis from online.

If the user is logged in already, show the get started button to say "Dashboard" or "Profile" instead to take them there.

## Responsiveness and formatting

Make sure pages are wrapped in a container to prevent the width stretching out on wide screens. Always make sure they are centered aligned and not off-center.

Always make sure that your designs are mobile responsive. Verify the formatting to ensure it has correct max and min widths as well as mobile responsiveness.

- Always create sidebars for protected dashboard pages and navigate between pages
- Always create navbars for landing pages
- On these bars, the created logo should be clickable and redirect to the index page

## Animating with Framer Motion

You must add animations to components using Framer Motion. It is already installed and configured in the project.

To use it, import the `motion` component from `framer-motion` and use it to wrap the component you want to animate.


### Other Items to animate
- Fade in and Fade Out
- Slide in and Slide Out animations
- Rendering animations
- Button clicks and UI elements

Animate for all components, including on landing page and app pages.

## Three JS Graphics

Your app comes with three js by default. You can use it to create 3D graphics for landing pages, games, etc.


## Colors

You can override colors in: `src/index.css`

This uses the oklch color format for tailwind v4.

Always use these color variable names.

Make sure all ui components are set up to be mobile responsive and compatible with both light and dark mode.

Set theme using `dark` or `light` variables at the parent className.

## Styling and Theming

When changing the theme, always change the underlying theme of the shad cn components app-wide under `src/components/ui` and the colors in the index.css file.

Avoid hardcoding in colors unless necessary for a use case, and properly implement themes through the underlying shad cn ui components.

When styling, ensure buttons and clickable items have pointer-click on them (don't by default).

Always follow a set theme style and ensure it is tuned to the user's liking.

## Toasts

You should always use toasts to display results to the user, such as confirmations, results, errors, etc.

Use the shad cn Sonner component as the toaster. For example:

```
import { toast } from "sonner"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
export function SonnerDemo() {
  return (
    <Button
      variant="outline"
      onClick={() =>
        toast("Event has been created", {
          description: "Sunday, December 03, 2023 at 9:00 AM",
          action: {
            label: "Undo",
            onClick: () => console.log("Undo"),
          },
        })
      }
    >
      Show Toast
    </Button>
  )
}
```

Remember to import { toast } from "sonner". Usage: `toast("Event has been created.")`

## Dialogs

Always ensure your larger dialogs have a scroll in its content to ensure that its content fits the screen size. Make sure that the content is not cut off from the screen.

Ideally, instead of using a new page, use a Dialog instead. 

# Using the Convex backend

You will be implementing the convex backend. Follow your knowledge of convex and the documentation to implement the backend.

## The Convex Schema

You must correctly follow the convex schema implementation.

The schema is defined in `src/convex/schema.ts`.

Do not include the `_id` and `_creationTime` fields in your queries (it is included by default for each table).
Do not index `_creationTime` as it is indexed for you. Never have duplicate indexes.


## Convex Actions: Using CRUD operations

When running anything that involves external connections, you must use a convex action with "use node" at the top of the file.

You cannot have queries or mutations in the same file as a "use node" action file. Thus, you must use pre-built queries and mutations in other files.

You can also use the pre-installed internal crud functions for the database:

```ts
// in convex/users.ts
import { crud } from "convex-helpers/server/crud";
import schema from "./schema.ts";

export const { create, read, update, destroy } = crud(schema, "users");

// in some file, in an action:
const user = await ctx.runQuery(internal.users.read, { id: userId });

await ctx.runMutation(internal.users.update, {
  id: userId,
  patch: {
    status: "inactive",
  },
});
```


## Common Convex Mistakes To Avoid

When using convex, make sure:
- Document IDs are referenced as `_id` field, not `id`.
- Document ID types are referenced as `Id<"TableName">`, not `string`.
- Document object types are referenced as `Doc<"TableName">`.
- Keep schemaValidation to false in the schema file.
- You must correctly type your code so that it passes the type checker.
- You must handle null / undefined cases of your convex queries for both frontend and backend, or else it will throw an error that your data could be null or undefined.
- Always use the `@/folder` path, with `@/convex/folder/file.ts` syntax for importing convex files.
- This includes importing generated files like `@/convex/_generated/server`, `@/convex/_generated/api`
- Remember to import functions like useQuery, useMutation, useAction, etc. from `convex/react`
- NEVER have return type validators.


# Enhanced Disaster Classification and Severity Prediction Model

This directory contains an improved PyTorch-based CNN model for disaster image classification and severity prediction on a scale of 1-10.

## Model Architecture

The model uses an enhanced multi-head CNN architecture:
- ResNet-like convolutional layers with batch normalization for better feature extraction
- Adaptive pooling for handling various image sizes
- Fully connected layers with batch normalization
- Multi-head output for both disaster type classification and severity prediction (1-10 scale)
- Dropout layers for regularization

## Disaster Types

The model can classify images into the following disaster types:
- Wildfire
- Flood
- Earthquake
- Hurricane
- Tornado

## Setup and Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a dataset directory structure:
   ```
   mkdir -p dataset/{Wildfire,Flood,Earthquake,Hurricane,Tornado}
   ```

3. Add training images to the respective disaster type folders.
   - The system can also use images from the uploads/tmp directory
   - Severity levels (1-10) are determined from image properties:
     - Edge intensity (more edges often indicate more severe damage)
     - Color variance (higher variance can indicate more chaotic scenes)
     - Average intensity (darker images may indicate more severe conditions)
   - If no images are available, the training script will create dummy data for testing purposes.

## Training the Model

To train the model, run:
```
python train.py
```

This will:
- Load the dataset from both dataset folders and uploads/tmp directory
- Determine severity levels from image properties
- Train the enhanced CNN model with both classification and regression tasks
- Save the best model to `best_model.pth`
- Generate training curves and a confusion matrix

## Testing the Model

To test the model with sample images:
```
python test_model_with_samples.py
```

This will:
- Load the trained model
- Select sample images from the uploads/tmp directory
- Make predictions on these images
- Display results in a figure saved as `test_results.png`
- Print prediction results to the console

## Using the Model

The Flask app (`app.py`) will automatically use the trained model if `best_model.pth` exists. If not, it will fall back to a deterministic approach based on filename hashing.

## API Endpoint

The model is accessible via the `/predict` endpoint:

```
POST /predict
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: [image file]
```

Response format:
```json
{
  "disaster_type": "Wildfire",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "disaster_level": 8,
  "severity_category": "High",
  "file_processed": "example.jpg",
  "status": "success"
}
```

Severity levels range from 1-10 and are categorized as:
- 1-3: Low
- 4-6: Medium
- 7-8: High
- 9-10: Extreme
```

## Fallback Mechanism

If the model fails to load or an error occurs during prediction, the system will automatically fall back to an improved deterministic approach that:

1. Determines disaster type by checking for keywords in the filename first
2. Falls back to filename hash if no keywords are found
3. Calculates severity (1-10) based on image properties:
   - Average intensity
   - Color variance
   - Edge detection
4. Falls back to file size-based severity if image analysis fails

This ensures consistent and meaningful results even when the trained model is unavailable.
